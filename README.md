This project involves an in-depth analysis of Target's operations in Brazil through a robust dataset containing 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. Utilizing SQL, I examine various dimensions such as order status, pricing, payment and freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews. The goal is to extract actionable insights into Target's operational efficiency, pricing strategies, payment and shipping processes, customer demographics, product characteristics, and customer satisfaction. Through this analysis, the project highlights how Target consistently delivers outstanding value, innovation, and an exceptional guest experience in the Brazilian market.
